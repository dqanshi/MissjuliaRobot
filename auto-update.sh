# Made by @MissJulia_Robot
# So you are tired of updating your pypi dependencies whenever they breaks.
# For example dependencies like youtube_dl, howdoi etc. aren't stable and they need to be updated to function properly.
# So, I have made a easy solution for you.
# If you are using this script in your project please don't remove these few lines, if you respect the creator.


# **Tip: you can run it in a different worker so that, it can be run independently of the main program
# Thus you can switch it on/off whenever you want.


# we first fetch the environment variables
geturl="${SOURCE_URL}"
authkey="${HEROKU_API_KEY}"
appname="${HEROKU_APP_NAME}"
reqpath='requirements.txt' # change if necessary

# while loop
while true; do

 # Read the dependencies
 while IFS= read -r line; do

   # Fetch all the outdated dependencies
   outdated=$(pip --disable-pip-version-check list --outdated)

   # Here i am using some pattern check to strip out unstable dependencies
   # Logic: if dependencies has == then it's version is fixed, and if it has < then it cannot exceed its current version
   if ! [[ $line =~ == ]] && ! [[ $line =~ '<' ]]; then
      
      # Check if any of the striped dependencies is outdated
      if grep -q "$line" <<< "$outdated"; then
   
          # deploy a new version
          curl -n -X POST "https://api.heroku.com/apps/${appname}/builds" \
