 - /camscanner: Reply to a image to scan and improve it's clarity.

**Instructions**
▪️The image should be a page with some written text on it (screenshots aren't permitted)
▪️The image should contain the page with four corners clearly visible
▪️The background should be somewhat darker than the page
▪️The image should contain only the page with no other objects like pencil, eraser etc. beside it(within the image)

**PRO TIP**
You can simply draw a border(a black square) around the portion you want to scan for better efficiency and edge detection
If you are still messed up send `/helpcamscanner` in pm for the tutorial !
